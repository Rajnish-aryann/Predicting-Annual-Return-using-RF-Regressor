Brainwaves Machine Learning Challenge Problem 1 hosted on hackerearth

Societe Generale (SocGen) is a French multinational banking and financial services company. With over 1,54,000 employees, based in 76 countries, they handle over 32 million clients throughout the world on a daily basis.

They provide services like retail banking, corporate and investment banking, asset management, portfolio management, insurance and other financial services.

With this problem, we’ll help SocGen in building the intelligence to predict, act and maximise their portfolio returns. Think of a portfolio as a basket. The basket can contain diverse instruments such as equity stocks, debentures, mutual funds etc. Each portfolio is allotted to portfolio managers. Intelligence about future performance would help these portfolio managers to act and take necessary steps in order to overcome losses.

In this challenge, given the randomly sampled data, you’ve to predict the portfolio’s annual returns. Keeping data privacy in mind, some of the variables have been anonymised.
